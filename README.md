# Math reference sheets

â€¦important definitions, theorems and lemmas in a compact format I wrote to support my exam preparations.

Covers large parts of what I revised for the exams of the _Analysis 1_ and _Analysis 2_ lectures I attended at KIT. The reference sheet covering linear algebra is currently in development as the corresponding exams are still in my future.
